# 0x08. Making Change

Given a pile of coins of different values, determine the fewest number of coins needed to meet a given amount total.

- Prototype: ```def makeChange(coins, total)```
- Return: fewest number of coins needed to meet total
- - If total is 0 or less, return 0
- - If total cannot be met by any number of coins you have, return -1
coins is a list of the values of the coins in your possession
- The value of a coin will always be an integer greater than 0
- You can assume you have an infinite number of each denomination of coin in the list
- Your solution’s runtime will be evaluated in this task
